# Runtime

A reimplementation of the game's rendering model, running off the exported level
JSON and the extracted PNGs. Python + PySDL2 over the system SDL2.

```sh
NFH_TEXTURES=/path/to/pngs python3 runtime/viewer.py levels/s1/Level101.json
```

Keys: arrows pan · `[` `]` previous/next level · `Z` zone overlay · `Space` pause
· `S` screenshot · `Esc` quit. Add `--shot=out.png` to render one frame headless
(pair it with `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=offscreen`).

## What it reproduces

Two draw passes, because the game itself has two — see `docs/GAMEPLAY.md` §8.

**World-space quads** go first. The level backdrop and a handful of static item
overlays are ordinary Unity `MeshRenderer`s on the built-in 10×10 Plane, laid
into XY and scaled, so their world size is `10 × (scale.x, scale.z)`. Level101's
backdrop works out to 14.28 × 7.36 units with the `house01` texture.

**Screen-space sprites** go second. Every animated object blits a frame of its
sheet with `Graphics.DrawTexture`, positioned by projecting its world transform
and offset in design pixels:

```python
sx, sy = camera.world_to_screen(x, y)          # ortho size 3, then H - y
scale  = screen_h / 600.0                      # 800x600 design resolution
dst    = (sx + (ctrl.dx + anim.dx) * scale,
          sy + (ctrl.dy + anim.dy) * scale,
          anim.OriginalWidth  * scale / anim.SheetColumns,
          anim.OriginalHeight * scale / anim.SheetRows)
```

Ordering is the `GUIDepth` enum, not z-sorting: higher value draws further back.

## Coverage

All 28 playable levels across both seasons render with every sprite placed and
no missing sheet:

```
Level101  drew 15/15 sprites; missing sheets: 0
...
Level214  drew 16/16 sprites; missing sheets: 0
```

## Things that bite

- **Transforms nest.** A door parented to a zone stores a local position;
  `tools/export_level.py` composes the chain and emits `world_position`.
- **Doors name their idle differently.** `Door` uses `IdleAnimation`, every other
  `Item` uses `IdleNormal`. Reading the wrong field silently selects animation 0,
  which for a door is "Woody walks through it" — the whole level then shows
  Woody standing inside every doorway.
- **`IdleNormal == 'NONE'` means "not a sprite".** Those objects are drawn as
  quads instead; giving them a sprite draws the wrong thing.
- **Sheet names are `Resources.Load` paths**, so some contain a subdirectory or
  a duplicate-asset suffix (`Closed/closeddoorback_ms`, `trashcan_ms (2)`). The
  texture cache tries the raw name, the flattened one, the basename, and the
  sanitised one.

## Not implemented

Everything in `docs/GAMEPLAY.md` §4–§7: the routine engine, trick state machine,
detection, alerters, anger and scoring. This draws a level; it does not play one.
Input is limited to panning the camera.
