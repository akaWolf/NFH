# Getting closer to the PC original — analysis, no changes made

The port's truth is the mobile decompile, and every runtime line cites it.
"Closer to PC" therefore cannot mean editing that runtime: it means an
explicit, switchable overlay — data patches plus a handful of rule switches —
whose every deviation cites a PC source the way the parity code cites
`Assembly-CSharp`. Without the PC data files the PC side is known only from
the 100 % guides and videos (see `docs/PC_VS_MOBILE.md`), so each item below
carries a confidence.

## 1. Five axes, three worth pursuing

| axis | what differs | pursue? |
|---|---|---|
| rules | S2 rating (+10 only for EXACTLY one overflow), no lives | yes — two switches |
| reachability | 114 (no whistle), 211/214 (colliders), 108 (one-off brushing), 206 (double overflow) | yes — data overlays, one small hook |
| routines / timing | laps re-authored by Nordi; PC laps unknown in numbers | only with PC data in hand |
| content / UX | dexterity mini-games, IAP gates, tap controls | yes for dexterity (a bypass), no for the rest |
| presentation | re-rendered sprites, cocos menus, HUD | no — assets, not behaviour |

## 2. Item by item

### 2.1 Level114 — the dog whistle (confidence: high on mechanism, medium on timing)

PC (guide): "wait for the neighbour to get vinyl, use dog whistle, use rusty
nail with record player, use gunpowder with tobacco tin, go back to the
kitchen". The whistle is an inventory item used from the kitchen; the dog
barks; the neighbour leaves the living room to check the dog and comes back.

Mobile: no whistle. The Dog is an `Alerter` in Zone06 that fires only with
Woody in its zone (Alerter.cs:81-84). The call chain it would need exists
already: `Alerter.WakeUp()` → `CoRoutineRottweilerHearAlerter` →
`Rottweiler.HearAlerter(alerter, triggeredByWoody)` → `StartSurpriseActionFar`
(he walks to the dog, Zone06, and returns to the interrupted action). In the
port: `AlerterFSM.wake_up` (world.py:1821) and `Routine.hear_alerter`
(world.py:4279).

Smallest PC-like change:

- overlay: a SearchItem "DogWhistle" (say in the hall's chest of drawers,
  where the PC keeps it) yielding an inventory type IT_Whistle;
- hook: an inventory use with no target ("use the whistle") that calls the
  Dog's `wake_up()` with `triggered_by_woody = False`, whatever zone Woody
  is in — about 40 lines in the port, behind the profile flag;
- nothing else: the graph already allows Zone03 ↔ Zone02, and the primed
  Gramaphone/Pipe accept Woody as soon as he is out (Item.cs:1520 is about
  `Primed`, not about his presence).

Expected result: 9 of 9 and 100 (57 points + 9 × 3 = 84 … with the two
tens 77 + 27 = 104 → capped). Risk: the length of his dog visit (the
SurpriseActionFar walk Zone02→Zone06→Zone02 ≈ 12-15 s in the port's
geometry) must cover the walk from the kitchen door to the Pipe (x −3.16)
and the Gramaphone (x 0.86) and back — the PC video is the reference for
how tight that was on PC.

### 2.2 Level108 — repeated brushing (confidence: high)

PC: he brushes his teeth every lap (the guide puts the brush in after his
balcony visit). Mobile: `RemoveFromRoutineAfterFirstUse` on the ToothBrush
(RoutineActionUse.cs:424-427), and the coffee's RushToToilet as the
replacement (his ToiletAction's item is the ToothBrush).

Overlay: `RemoveFromRoutineAfterFirstUse = false`. Side effect: the rush
still targets the ToothBrush, so a tricked brush pays at the first of the
two — the rating is 100 either way; this one is fidelity, not score.

### 2.3 Level211 rod, Level214 wheel — colliders (confidence: high)

PC: both tricks are ordinary clicks. Mobile: the FishingRod's box lies inside
the door's (x −5.27..−4.42, y 1.91..2.25 within −5.86..−4.06, 1.67..2.93)
and the door is nearer the camera, so the raycast — and the port's z-ordered
stand-in for it — answers "door"; the wheel is the same defect in a smaller
form (the App Store review: "only works if you touch its top").

Two ways, choose the overlay:

- overlay: shrink the door's collider (or lift the rod's z) in
  `levels/pc/Level211.overlay.json` — data only, touches one level;
- code: "a TrickItem beats a Door on overlap" in the hit-test — one rule for
  every level, but it changes what the parity runtime answers on the
  mobile's own bugs, so it must stay behind the profile.

Expected: 211 → 8 of 8, 90 (+10 with the overflow rule below).

### 2.4 Season 2 rating — "fill the gauge" (confidence: medium)

PC guide: "completely fill up the gauge on the left" plus every trick.
Mobile: `+10 iff AngryCountTicks == 1` (GameInfo.cs:413-416). The PC text
reads as "at least once"; the exact PC formula is not known.

Switch: `ticks >= 1`. Effect: Level206's two overflows stop costing the
bonus (100), and the arm-the-earliest-last constraint relaxes to "overflow
at all" — 202/205/208/210 still need the meter to cross once, which their
spread does not give (peaks 68-97), so they stay at 90 unless the overlay
also tightens the arming (it should not: that is the runner, not the game).

### 2.5 Lives (confidence: medium)

PC "On Vacation" gives three attempts (4PDA, 2017: "на компьютере было 3
попытки возрождения, здесь одна"); PC Season 1 has none, like the mobile.
The mobile code has no lives at all — being caught ends the level. A PC
profile would need a "caught → resume" path: what the PC resumes to (the
same moment? the level start with the tricks kept?) has to be read off the
PC video before it is worth writing. Score-neutral; leave for last.

### 2.6 Dexterity mini-games (confidence: high)

PC has none. Port: `_dexterity_gate` (world.py:7228) arms the minigame on
the first pass and lets the second through. Profile switch: return the
"done" branch on the first pass (auto-solve). The `unlock` legs in the plans
become no-ops under the profile; the plans still run.

### 2.7 Routines and timings (confidence: low without data)

Everything above keeps the mobile laps. The PC laps are different (the PC
108 brushes each lap; the PC 114 "gets vinyl" as a routine step; the PC
guide's waits — "wait for him to go to the balcony" — imply room orders that
sometimes differ from the mobile's ActionManager lists). Reproducing them
needs either the PC data (the GOG/Steam "Neighbours from Hell Compilation";
its level scripts would have to be unpacked — format not known here) or
frame-timed references from the PC videos (per-episode room sequence with
timestamps). Without one of those, re-authoring laps would be guesswork —
exactly what CLAUDE.md forbids.

### 2.8 Not worth it

Art, menus, HUD, tap controls (the port is already mouse-driven), IAP gates
(the port has none), Olga/Mother as catchers (the PC NFH2 mum catches too —
"avoid mum or else you will get beaten").

## 3. Shape of a PC profile in the port

- `--profile pc` (default `mobile`, i.e. today's behaviour, untouched).
- `levels/pc/<Level>.overlay.json`: JSON merge patches applied after the
  mobile load — flags (108), collider rects (211/214), added objects (114's
  whistle). Each entry carries a `"source"` string (guide URL / video
  timestamp), the PC analogue of the runtime's `// cs:` citations.
- `Game.rules`: `overflow_bonus = 'exactly_one' | 'at_least_one'`,
  `dexterity = 'minigame' | 'auto'`, `lives = 0 | 3`.
- The whistle hook is the only new mechanism; it lives in the profile
  branch and is inert in `mobile`.
- `tests/plans/pc/`: the plans that differ (114 with the whistle, 211 with
  the rod, 206 unchanged but expected 100); the summary table gains a
  profile column. The bench stays mobile-only: the emulator cannot validate
  PC claims.

## 4. Validation

1. Plans: the same harness, `--profile pc`; expected: 114 → 9/9 100,
   211 → 8/8 100, 206 → 100, 108 unchanged, everything else identical to
   the mobile profile (a regression that must hold — the profile must not
   move a single mobile number).
2. PC references: for 114 and 211 the Badinfos / Steam-guide videos give the
   sequence; if frame timing matters (the whistle window), the storyboard
   frames are too coarse (10 s) — a full download needs YouTube cookies
   from a logged-in browser (this machine's IP is bot-checked without them).
3. If the PC data ever arrives: diff its routines against
   `levels/*.json` ActionManager lists and turn §2.7 into overlays too.

## 5. Order of work

| item | gains | effort | risk to parity | needs PC data |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S2 overflow rule `>= 1` | 206 → 100 | trivial | none (switch) | no |
| 211 / 214 collider overlays | 211 → 100 | small | none (profile data) | no |
| 114 whistle | 114 → 100 | small-medium (one hook) | low (profile-only code) | timing only |
| dexterity auto | fidelity | trivial | none | no |
| 108 brushing flag | fidelity | trivial | none | no |
| lives | fidelity | medium | low | video |
| PC laps | fidelity | large | high if guessed | yes |

With the first three, every level the mobile machinery blocks reaches 100
under the profile; the remaining 90s (202/205/208/210) are the runner's
arming pace against the neighbour's lap, which is the same problem on PC and
is not a fidelity question.
