# Getting closer to the PC original — analysis, no changes made

The port's truth is the mobile decompile, and every runtime line cites it.
"Closer to PC" therefore cannot mean editing that runtime: it means an
explicit, switchable overlay — data patches plus a handful of rule switches —
whose every deviation cites a PC source the way the parity code cites
`Assembly-CSharp`. Without the PC data files the PC side is known only from
the 100 % guides and videos (see `docs/PC_VS_MOBILE.md`), so each item below
carries a confidence.

## 1. Five axes, three worth pursuing

| axis | what differs | pursue? |
|---|---|---|
| rules | S2 rating (+10 only for EXACTLY one overflow), no lives | yes — two switches |
| reachability | 114 (no whistle), 211/214 (colliders), 108 (one-off brushing), 206 (double overflow) | yes — data overlays, one small hook |
| routines / timing | laps re-authored by Nordi; PC laps unknown in numbers | only with PC data in hand |
| content / UX | dexterity mini-games, IAP gates, tap controls | yes for dexterity (a bypass), no for the rest |
| presentation | re-rendered sprites, cocos menus, HUD | no — assets, not behaviour |

## 2. Item by item

### 2.1 Level114 — the dog whistle (confidence: high on mechanism, medium on timing)

PC (guide): "wait for the neighbour to get vinyl, use dog whistle, use rusty
nail with record player, use gunpowder with tobacco tin, go back to the
kitchen". The whistle is an inventory item used from the kitchen; the dog
barks; the neighbour leaves the living room to check the dog and comes back.

Mobile: no whistle. The Dog is an `Alerter` in Zone06 that fires only with
Woody in its zone (Alerter.cs:81-84). The call chain it would need exists
already: `Alerter.WakeUp()` → `CoRoutineRottweilerHearAlerter` →
`Rottweiler.HearAlerter(alerter, triggeredByWoody)` → `StartSurpriseActionFar`
(he walks to the dog, Zone06, and returns to the interrupted action). In the
port: `AlerterFSM.wake_up` (world.py:1821) and `Routine.hear_alerter`
(world.py:4279).

Smallest PC-like change:

- overlay: a SearchItem "DogWhistle" (say in the hall's chest of drawers,
  where the PC keeps it) yielding an inventory type IT_Whistle;
- hook: an inventory use with no target ("use the whistle") that calls the
  Dog's `wake_up()` with `triggered_by_woody = False`, whatever zone Woody
  is in — about 40 lines in the port, behind the profile flag;
- nothing else: the graph already allows Zone03 ↔ Zone02, and the primed
  Gramaphone/Pipe accept Woody as soon as he is out (Item.cs:1520 is about
  `Primed`, not about his presence).

Expected result: 9 of 9 and 100 (57 points + 9 × 3 = 84 … with the two
tens 77 + 27 = 104 → capped). Risk: the length of his dog visit (the
SurpriseActionFar walk Zone02→Zone06→Zone02 ≈ 12-15 s in the port's
geometry) must cover the walk from the kitchen door to the Pipe (x −3.16)
and the Gramaphone (x 0.86) and back — the PC video is the reference for
how tight that was on PC.

### 2.2 Level108 — brushing (confidence: high — MEASURED, see docs/PC_LAPS.md)

Measured on the PC video: the neighbour brushes his teeth ONCE at the
start (5-23 s) and never again in the routine; the toothbrush comes back
only as the rinse after the soil coffee. That is exactly the mobile data
(`RemoveFromRoutineAfterFirstUse` on the ToothBrush, the CoffeeMaker's
RushToToilet with the ToothBrush as his ToiletAction). Nothing to change
here; the earlier claim that "PC brushes every lap" was a misread of the
frame sheets (Woody in the bathroom, not the neighbour).

### 2.3 Level211 rod, Level214 wheel — colliders (confidence: high)

PC: both tricks are ordinary clicks. Mobile: the FishingRod's box lies inside
the door's (x −5.27..−4.42, y 1.91..2.25 within −5.86..−4.06, 1.67..2.93)
and the door is nearer the camera, so the raycast — and the port's z-ordered
stand-in for it — answers "door"; the wheel is the same defect in a smaller
form (the App Store review: "only works if you touch its top").

Two ways, choose the overlay:

- overlay: shrink the door's collider (or lift the rod's z) in
  `levels/pc/Level211.overlay.json` — data only, touches one level;
- code: "a TrickItem beats a Door on overlap" in the hit-test — one rule for
  every level, but it changes what the parity runtime answers on the
  mobile's own bugs, so it must stay behind the profile.

Expected: 211 → 8 of 8, 90 (+10 with the overflow rule below).

### 2.4 Season 2 rating — "fill the gauge" (confidence: high — measured)

PC: points (coins + a COLLAPSE bonus + time; E10's end screen 8000 + 3000 +
5000 + 1398, the map counting 8/8 coins), and the gauge may fill more than
once — Badinfos' 100 % run fills it twice in 210 and 214. The gauge decays
at ~0.4 %/s on PC as well (`tools/pcref/gauge.py`), so the mobile's 0.37/s
is the PC's constant; only the "exactly one" is the remake's.

Switch: `ticks >= 1`. Effect: Level206's two overflows stop costing the
bonus (100), and the arm-the-earliest-last constraint relaxes to "overflow
at all" — 202/205/208/210 still need the meter to cross once, which their
spread does not give (peaks 68-97), so they stay at 90 unless the overlay
also tightens the arming (it should not: that is the runner, not the game).

### 2.5 Lives (confidence: medium)

PC "On Vacation" gives three attempts (4PDA, 2017: "на компьютере было 3
попытки возрождения, здесь одна"); PC Season 1 has none, like the mobile.
The mobile code has no lives at all — being caught ends the level. A PC
profile would need a "caught → resume" path: what the PC resumes to (the
same moment? the level start with the tricks kept?) has to be read off the
PC video before it is worth writing. Score-neutral; leave for last.

### 2.6 Dexterity mini-games (confidence: high)

PC has none. Port: `_dexterity_gate` (world.py:7228) arms the minigame on
the first pass and lets the second through. Profile switch: return the
"done" branch on the first pass (auto-solve). The `unlock` legs in the plans
become no-ops under the profile; the plans still run.

### 2.7 Routines and timings (confidence: high — MEASURED, docs/PC_LAPS.md)

Measured for all 28 episodes from the PC videos' HUD bubble: the ORDER of
the neighbour's activities is the PC's in every episode; the periods are
within ±15 % in 17 of 27, and the mobile is slower by 20-80 % in 101, 105,
107, 110, 112, 114, 210, 211, 212 (single actions that last longer — the
sofa, the pottery chain, the deck-chair sleep). A PC-timing profile would
therefore not re-order anything; it would shorten specific action
durations, and `docs/PC_LAPS_DETAIL.md` has the PC per-activity durations
to set them from. Still not from PC data — from video, ±2 s.

### 2.8 Not worth it

Art, menus, HUD, tap controls (the port is already mouse-driven), IAP gates
(the port has none), Olga/Mother as catchers (the PC NFH2 mum catches too —
"avoid mum or else you will get beaten").

## 3. Shape of a PC profile in the port

- `--profile pc` (default `mobile`, i.e. today's behaviour, untouched).
- `levels/pc/<Level>.overlay.json`: JSON merge patches applied after the
  mobile load — flags (108), collider rects (211/214), added objects (114's
  whistle). Each entry carries a `"source"` string (guide URL / video
  timestamp), the PC analogue of the runtime's `// cs:` citations.
- `Game.rules`: `overflow_bonus = 'exactly_one' | 'at_least_one'`,
  `dexterity = 'minigame' | 'auto'`, `lives = 0 | 3`.
- The whistle hook is the only new mechanism; it lives in the profile
  branch and is inert in `mobile`.
- `tests/plans/pc/`: the plans that differ (114 with the whistle, 211 with
  the rod, 206 unchanged but expected 100); the summary table gains a
  profile column. The bench stays mobile-only: the emulator cannot validate
  PC claims.

## 4. Validation

1. Plans: the same harness, `--profile pc`; expected: 114 → 9/9 100,
   211 → 8/8 100, 206 → 100, 108 unchanged, everything else identical to
   the mobile profile (a regression that must hold — the profile must not
   move a single mobile number).
2. PC references: for 114 and 211 the Badinfos / Steam-guide videos give the
   sequence; if frame timing matters (the whistle window), the storyboard
   frames are too coarse (10 s) — a full download needs YouTube cookies
   from a logged-in browser (this machine's IP is bot-checked without them).
3. If the PC data ever arrives: diff its routines against
   `levels/*.json` ActionManager lists and turn §2.7 into overlays too.

## 5. Order of work

| item | gains | effort | risk to parity | needs PC data |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S2 overflow rule `>= 1` | 206 → 100 | trivial | none (switch) | no |
| 211 / 214 collider overlays | 211 → 100 | small | none (profile data) | no |
| 114 whistle | 114 → 100 | small-medium (one hook) | low (profile-only code) | timing only |
| dexterity auto | fidelity | trivial | none | no |
| 108 brushing flag | fidelity | trivial | none | no |
| lives | fidelity | medium | low | video |
| PC laps | fidelity | large | high if guessed | yes |

With the first three, every level the mobile machinery blocks reaches 100
under the profile; the remaining 90s (202/205/208/210) are the runner's
arming pace against the neighbour's lap, which is the same problem on PC and
is not a fidelity question.

## 6. PC references on disk

`~/nfh-bench/pcref/` (outside /tmp, survives the nightly reboot; index in
its README.txt): Badinfos' two full 100 % runs (PC episodes 1-14 and
On Vacation 1-14, 360p) and TheMusician05's episodes 1-6 / 7-10 (the
latter 720p). Fetched with `yt-dlp -4`: pcnew's IPv6 route exits through
BlueVPS (Madrid) and gets YouTube's bot check, the IPv4 route does not —
no cookies needed.

Reading them: `ffmpeg -ss <s> -t 60 -i x.mp4 -vf "fps=1/2,scale=384:-1,
tile=5x6" -frames:v 1 t.png` gives a minute per sheet; the PC HUD clock
(top right, counting down from the episode's 7:00) is the time base, and
the episode title card marks the start (A Sunny Morning: 5:08 into
pc_ep7-10_tm05.mp4).

The frame-sheet reading of A Sunny Morning that first stood here
("a bathroom visit every lap") was wrong — it counted Woody. The
measurement that holds is the HUD bubble method of `tools/pcref/` and
its results in `docs/PC_LAPS.md`: 108's PC lap is 95-97 s, the mobile's
95, the order identical, the toothbrush once at the start on both.
